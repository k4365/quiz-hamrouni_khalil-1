## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Quiz Game? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/k4365/quiz-hamrouni_khalil-1/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/k4365/quiz-hamrouni_khalil-1/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, the number of comments is a reasonable proxy for the amount of interest a particular issue has generated.
